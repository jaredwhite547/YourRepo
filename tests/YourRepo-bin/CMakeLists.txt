#These tests directly run the driver executable. These type of tests are useful for testing command line arguments, calling external test scripts, and other forms of tests. For example, if your C++ project builds a python package, you might be able to call the python tests from here.

#We manually create the path to the executable since the target name and OUTPUT_NAME are no longer the same.
#CMake functions can't return a value, so the first argument is an output variable.
